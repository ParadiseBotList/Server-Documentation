# Trials
When applying for either the Website Mod or Website Admin positions you will first be run through a 1 week trial period,
In this trial period you're not expected to do anything but the job you applied for, this period is for us to monitor you as a user
aswell as how you fit into our community.

At the end of the week all of the higher staff will sit down and discuss if you are a good fit for our community and if not why.
