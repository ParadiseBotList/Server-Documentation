# Trials
When applying for either the Website Mod or Website Admin positions you will first be run through a 1 week trial period,
In this trial period you're not expected to do anything but the job you applied for, this period is for us to monitor you as a user
aswell as how you fit into our community.

At the end of the week all of the higher staff will sit down and discuss if you are a good fit for our community and if not why,
you will be contacted with more details on the situation and kept up to date on what is happening.

Do not DM us or continuously pinging us asking us how you're doing, or if you did something right if you need help it's not a crime to ask
but keep it simple you should know if what you're doing is right or wrong.
