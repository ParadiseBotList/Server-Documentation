# Certification
Here at Paradise Bots we believe in giving back to the community that helped us get to where we are.
A big part of how we achieve this is through our "programs" these programs include Certification and Partnership.

Our Certificaton Program is our way of giving developers credit for the programs or applications that they make,
by certifying a bot they get access to a few new features such as:
* A Fancy new Badge for their Bot on our Website.
* Access to the "certified-bots" Channel (less common prefix spam).
* Certified Bot role.
* Certified Dev role.
