# Inactivity

Want to take a break from chatting without the risk of getting kicked?  Let us know here.  A simple "Hey I'm going to take a break" is good for two weeks.

Feel free to delete your message after you get back. Letting us know that you're gonna be inactive will allow us to give you the Leave Of Absence role.
