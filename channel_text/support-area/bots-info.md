# Bots Info

Like many servers, we utilize various bots to assist in the administration of various tasks as well as provide services to our members.  In order to be transparent about all the bots on our servers, this channel is used to provide context and details on each one and how they are deployed through the server.

All our official bots have the `Paradise Bots | <@&748977820776267875>` role and have full access to the "Server Admin" category of the server.

## Trusted Bots
`Skynet | <@650872568374493185>` is a Auto Moderation bot that allows us to set limits on how many times a audit log event can be triggered in a row,
before it alerts us of the event and takes action on the user who is triggering them.
