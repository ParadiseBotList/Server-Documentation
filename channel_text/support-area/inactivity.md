# Staff Inactivity

Want to take a break without the risk of getting kicked?  Let us know here.  A simple "Hey I'm going to take a break" is good for two weeks.

Feel free to delete your message after you get back. Letting us know that you're gonna be inactive will allow us to give you the Leave Of Absence role.

# Bot Inactivity
Though it isn't a rule that is strongly enforced we allow a 4-7 day grace period for bots who are offline, We understand that updates happen
and so do downtime's if the owner tells us the bot is gonna be down then an exception can be made.
