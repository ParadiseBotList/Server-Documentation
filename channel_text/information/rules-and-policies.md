# Rules and Policies

On behalf of the staff and all our members, we're happy to have you here.  Please take a moment to read through our rules and polices.  There are a lot of them and we know you won't remember them all.  But please note that by joining our membership you agree to abide by them.  These rules are written with everyone's safety and security in mind, including yours.

---

## Policies

1.  The Server Admins have final authority on all server-related decisions, including, but not limited to, server content, membership, moderator actions, bans, mutes, etc.  Their word is final, without further review.  Admins have wide-sweeping authority and the responsibility that comes with it.
2.  The Approvers have final authority on all bot-related decisions, including, but not limited to, approval, denial, mute, kick, ban, etc. Their word is final, without further review. Approved have Paradise related authority and the responsibility that comes with it.
3.  The Moderators have delegated authority to **mute**, **ban** any Discord user.  They exercise these permissions for the betterment of the server and to assist in keeping this place safe.  Permanent bans are decided on a case-by-case basis and if a user is found to be particularly toxic or disruptive, may face immediate permanent ban.
4.  Members who have specific complaints about another member should DM a member of our staff team.  Please do not publicly denounce someone.
5.  The Admins and Moderators balance the needs of the community with the specific needs of an individual.  When in doubt, safety and security will supersede the short-term harm that may come to the server.  If you're being harassed by a specific member, please let a staff member know.  Even if they aren't breaking a rule, if someone makes you uncomfortable, **LET US KNOW!!**  We can't help you if we don't know.  If a member of staff is making you uncomfortable, please let a Head Admin or Owner know.
6.  While staff members are entrusted with additional responsibility, they are not above the rules.  If you see a staff member breaking the rules, please DM a head admin.

**__We are, first and foremost, a community__**

Paradise has many features: partnership, certification, verification, and most importantly: chat and VC.

You should treat this server like you would your local Bot List group.

## "Competing" Servers and Server Invites

We know you have your choice of servers and we thank you for joining ours.  In order to keep membership harassment to a minimum, we ask that you refrain from advertising other Bot Listing servers in-channel.  We want to be supportive and encourage everyone to explore and share these other servers in established DMs upon request.

DMing members solely to advertise other servers is prohibited and users who receive such DMs should report them immediately.

Admins, moderators, and other staff members of these servers are respectfully requested to apply for [Partnership](https://paradisebots.net/apps/partner) prior to creating an introduction.  Generally speaking, there would be concern that you are here solely to recruit members to your server.  However, we also know that you may want to go some place where "you're not in charge".  All we ask is that you be honest with us so that your intentions are clear.

Please note that while you are welcome here, we reserve the right to limit your interactions.  For example, even if you are a bot dev, we may block access to dev related channels.  Or we may make it so that you cannot join VC.


We're not asking much here and believe this balances the desire to hang out as well as maintaining transparency.  You are welcome to use an alt account to maintain anonymity, so long as these alts follow the policy outlined in "Alts/Multiple Accounts" below.  However, using an alt account to **circumvent** this policy is not only rude but bad form.

## Alts/Multiple Accounts

Generally speaking, having multiple accounts (commonly referred to as alts) on this server is frowned upon.  While not completely against the rules, sometimes you want to be anonymous and want to lurk without drawing attention.  So long as your alt does not disrupt the decorum and general atmosphere of the server, you *may* have multiple accounts here.  However, if the mods believe you are using an alt to circumvent a block, exceed vote count requirements or to harass users, the mods have full discretion to take mod action against all accounts that they reasonably believe belong to you, up to and including a ban.

---

## Breaking Rules

Everyone here is about having a fun time.  But rule breaks are going to happen.  *Generally speaking*, members who are found to be in violation of the rules may be disciplined in one of the following methods, in order of severity:
- **Verbal Warning**: Staff will ping the individual who has broken the rule and remind them kindly to keep the rules in mind.  This is often for minor infractions.
- **Mute**: Staff will ping the individual who has broken the rule and prevent them from chatting.
- **Official Warning**: Staff will name and ping the individual who has broken the rule and why they are receiving the warning..
- **Ban**: Staff will name and ping the individual who has broken the rule and why they are being banned.

Get too many warnings, you'll be banned.  There's no formula and it's up to the discretion of the Paradise Staff Team.

The policies in this channel are managed and tracked through Github.  Major rewrites to the rules will increase the first (or major) number of the version number while minor additions/subtractions will increase the second number (known as a minor number).  Typographical revisions, spelling corrections, etc. will add a third (patch) number.  The rule version is always available on the last message in this channel and diffs between each version can be found on in the repository: <https://github.com/ParadiseBotList/Server-Documentation>

Generally speaking, patches to the rules (the last kind of change), will be done through edits to the original message.  Other changes will often require a full purge and reload of the rules.  We will also let you know via a post in the paradise-updates channel that the policies have been updated.
